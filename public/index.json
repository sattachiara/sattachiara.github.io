More than a decade ago, I graduated in Languages and Communication at the University of Cagliari and after spending some years as freelancer tutor of English in Italy, I decided to move to the UK to improve my English language skills but also to seek further professional opportunities.\nI was 7 years old when I started studying English. When I was 13 I started writing down song\u0026rsquo;s lyrics while listening to music cassettes to learn more words. English has always been a passion and a top priority in my development. I have always imagined living in an English speaking country at some point. While I started learning it in primary school, it was only when teenager and with the advent of MTV music videos that I truly got to appreciate it.\nPrior coming to the UK, I worked in very different roles: from a family bakery every summer, to cleaning VIP villas during summertime, I started interpreting and translation during the university in Cagliari. In 2011, I took an internship at a local paint factory that was expanding their operations beyond the Italian border, in North Africa. For Marroncolor s.r.l., I did interpreting and translation services from English/French to Italian and helped with their negotiations during conference calls.\nFrom 2011 to early 2015, while studying for my bachelor’s degree I offered study support and tutoring to young adults with a particular focus on English as a school subject.\nNetflix and real time streaming services weren\u0026rsquo;t a thing at the time, and being a superfan of US and British TV series that were not available on TV yet, I volunteered as a translator for subtitling platforms that were providing subtitles for TV series online.\n","date":"April 15, 2024","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/beforetheuk/","summary":"Until 2015 I was born and bred in Sardinia.

Later that same year I obtained a job at the Trumpington Street Medical Practice, gp practice from the NHS – the British National Health Services - as an Administrator.\nThis was one of the largest GP practices in the whole town with an estimate of 18,000 patients. There, my responsibility varied greatly. I was responsible for dealing with patients’ requests in a very fast paced and challenging environment, but I also worked across different software, systems and large screening programme databases to hit the practice targets. At the medical practice, I had the chance again to do interpretation and translation services to the many foreign patients that visited the practice every day.\nUntil this point, I had what British call a \u0026lsquo;squiggly career\u0026rsquo;. As I approached two years working in the NHS, I decided to go back to study to give myself another chance in a career in communication.\nWhile the NHS offered the perfect language playground, with such a massive exposition to some incredibly different accents from all over the world, in 20§17 I eventually enrolled in a master’s degree in Intercultural Communication at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge.\n2017 Anglia Ruskin University 2017 has been one of the most challenging, yet exciting times of my adult life.\nFrom 2017 to 2018 I studied intercultural communication on a course run by members of the Anglia Ruskin Research Centre for Intercultural and Multilingual Studies (ARRCIMS).\nI acquired new key skills: from complex text analysis to language and identity policy development, the master’s degree offered me great opportunities. From advocating for students’ wellbeing as student representative, to enrolling into an internship for the Cambridge branch of ProQuest - the giant Michigan-based global information-content publishing and technology company. In this role, I contributed to build their ProQuest exclusive product LION (Literature Online Database). By conducting thorough research online, I supported the business\u0026rsquo;s mission by compiling their literature movements and biographies sections.\nIn 2018, I graduated and joined a very small Cambridge-based company called Frameworks Education Group as their International Enrolments, Marketing and Admin Support on a full-time basis. In this role I started moving my first steps in the marketing and communication sector. Working on their main platforms StudyCELTA.com and ELTCampus.com the company promoted and marketed CELTA, other TEFL and online courses. I was involved in the design of targeted communication and marketing campaigns supporting the Marketing Officer. In this company, I oversaw the writing, planning, and coordinating of social media content as well as writing blogs, monthly newsletter read by more than 20k people around the world.\n","date":"April 15, 2024","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/britishadventure/","summary":"2015 In 2015, I moved to Cambridge with Salvatore, my husband.\nWe jumped on the British adventure with two luggages each, no job offer and only five days of bed \u0026amp; breakfast booked.\nAfter the first few weeks adjusting to the cold and damp, I found a volunteering opportunity in the bookshop of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals – RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK.","tags":null,"title":"Our British adventure"},{"categories":null,"contents":"2020 until now In February 2020, I got a job as an Insight Analyst in the Customer Insight team at Cambridge University Press \u0026amp; Assessment, English - part of the University of Cambridge. For two months right before the pandemic started, I worked in this fast-paced team doing sentiment and text analysis on customer survey material to build one of the largest customer experience database in the whole organisation.\nBut as my goal was still working in comms, at the same time as this job, I had applied for a role of Communication Coordinator in the PR team in the same department and got the role in April. While the lockdown had just started, I also started my journey at Cambridge.\nIn 2022, I was then promoted to Global PR \u0026amp; Communications Executive and more recently, in October 2023 I landed a job as a Senior Marketing \u0026amp; Communications Executive at the newly created department of Partnership for Education at Cambridge University Press \u0026amp; Assessment, International.\nMy role at Partnership for Education and the project with HP At Partnership for Education, I am the Communication Lead for a multi-million pound project called the HP Cambridge Partnership for Education EdTech Fellowship. The project aims to equip senior government leaders with knowledge and skills to lead impactful EdTech transformations in education systems across the world.\nI am responsible for planning the marketing and communications strategies and activities for the entire lifecycle of the project. I translate the strategy into tactics with decisions on appropriate actions, resourcing, and deadlines. While managing the delivery of the project, I look after and nurture the relationship with the HP and liaise with major partners to establish the successful delivery of each phase of the project, ensuring a truly collaborative approach. In this role I\u0026rsquo;m a marketing and comms generalist, I work across different marketing and comms functions and activities, from writing PR, social media, brand reputation and event organisation.\nWorking with international colleagues My career at Cambridge has truly provided me with the greatest privilege of collaborating with teams located in five continents, across more than 20 countries and on multiple projects.\nThe most recent collaboration has been with colleagues from our business development teams located in India and Singapore to recruit senior government officials in South and Southeast Asia. Less recently, I collaborated with our team Qatar and UAE on the same HP project, and then in Mexico for the development of ad-hoc communication around the celebration of an important anniversary at the British Embassy in Ciudad de México.\nThe opportunities This journey at Cambridge has given me incredible opportunities. I worked across comms development, crisis comms and reputational risk management for example in Vietnam for Cambridge English and to the development of a project with the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Digital Transformation. These collaborations made me realise even more how much I love to navigate identity and cultural diversities, paying even more attention to sensitivities and communicative differences.\nA particularly proud moment has been when I pushed for the distribution of the 110 years of Cambridge C2 Proficiency exam that secured the organisation a wild coverage on BBC News, ITV News East Anglia, The Daily Mail and The Mirror Online and granted me an opportunity to visit the archives and look first hand at the original C2 paper exam from 1913. In this organisation, I also had the opportunity to attend radio interviews in Italy as well as podcasts and interviews with newspapers such as Business Insider IT.\nFurther development and future of my career Since I joined the organisation in 2020, I have been supporting the business and Cambridge senior leadership teams to identify risks and new opportunities. I am now looking for getting closer to my family in South Europe, find new opportunities in Marketing and Communication and improve my Spanish language skills hopefully by moving to Spain.\n","date":"April 15, 2024","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/myexperienceatcambridge/","summary":"2020 until now In February 2020, I got a job as an Insight Analyst in the Customer Insight team at Cambridge University Press \u0026amp; Assessment, English - part of the University of Cambridge.
