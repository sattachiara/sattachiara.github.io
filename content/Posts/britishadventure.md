##### 2015

In 2015, I moved to Cambridge with Salvatore, my husband.

We jumped on the British adventure with two luggages each, no job offer and only five days of bed & breakfast booked.

After the first few weeks adjusting to the cold and damp, I found a volunteering opportunity in the bookshop of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals – RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK.

In the same year, I worked for Ecco Shop, a shoe shop in the city centre of Cambridge, which gave me a great chance to meet many people and improve my language skills. Later that same year I obtained a job at the Trumpington Street Medical Practice, gp practice from the NHS – the British National Health Services - as an Administrator. 

This was one of the largest GP practices in the whole town with an estimate of 18,000 patients. There, my responsibility varied greatly. I was responsible for dealing with patients’ requests in a very fast paced and challenging environment, but I also worked across different software, systems and large screening programme databases to hit the practice targets. At the medical practice, I had the chance again to do interpretation and translation services to the many foreign patients that visited the practice every day.

Until this point, I had what British call a 'squiggly career'. As I approached two years working in the NHS, I decided to go back to study to give myself another chance in a career in communication. 

While the NHS offered the perfect language playground, with such a massive exposition to some incredibly different accents from all over the world, in 20§17 I eventually enrolled in a master’s degree in Intercultural Communication at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge.

##### 2017 Anglia Ruskin University

2017 has been one of the most challenging, yet exciting times of my adult life. 

From 2017 to 2018 I studied intercultural communication on a course run by members of the Anglia Ruskin Research Centre for Intercultural and Multilingual Studies (ARRCIMS).

I acquired new key skills: from complex text analysis to language and identity policy development, the master’s degree offered me great opportunities. From advocating for students’ wellbeing as student representative, to enrolling into an internship for the Cambridge branch of ProQuest - the giant Michigan-based global information-content publishing and technology company. In this role, I contributed to build their ProQuest exclusive product LION (Literature Online Database). By conducting thorough research online, I supported the business's mission by compiling their literature movements and biographies sections.

In 2018, I graduated and joined a very small Cambridge-based company called Frameworks Education Group as their International Enrolments, Marketing and Admin Support on a full-time basis. In this role I started moving my first steps in the marketing and communication sector. Working on their main platforms StudyCELTA.com and ELTCampus.com the company promoted and marketed CELTA, other TEFL and online courses. I was involved in the design of targeted communication and marketing campaigns supporting the Marketing Officer. In this company, I oversaw the writing, planning, and coordinating of social media content as well as writing blogs, monthly newsletter read by more than 20k people around the world.
