##### 2020 until now

In February 2020, I got a job as an Insight Analyst in the Customer Insight team at Cambridge University Press & Assessment, English - part of the University of Cambridge. For two months right before the pandemic started, I worked in this fast-paced team doing sentiment and text analysis on customer survey material to build one of the largest customer experience database in the whole organisation.

But as my goal was still working in comms, at the same time as this job, I had applied for a role of Communication Coordinator in the PR team in the same department and got the role in April. While the lockdown had just started, I also started my journey at Cambridge.

In 2022, I was then promoted to Global PR & Communications Executive and more recently, in October 2023 I landed a job as a Senior Marketing & Communications Executive at the newly created department of Partnership for Education at Cambridge University Press & Assessment, International.

###### My role at Partnership for Education and the project with HP 

At Partnership for Education, I am the Communication Lead for a multi-million pound project called the HP Cambridge Partnership for Education EdTech Fellowship. The project aims to equip senior government leaders with knowledge and skills to lead impactful EdTech transformations in education systems across the world.

I am responsible for planning the marketing and communications strategies and activities for the entire lifecycle of the project. I translate the strategy into tactics with decisions on appropriate actions, resourcing, and deadlines. While managing the delivery of the project, I look after and nurture the relationship with the HP and liaise with major partners to establish the successful delivery of each phase of the project, ensuring a truly collaborative approach. In this role I'm a marketing and comms generalist, I work across different marketing and comms functions and activities, from writing PR, social media, brand reputation and event organisation.

###### Working with international colleagues

My career at Cambridge has truly provided me with the greatest privilege of collaborating with teams located in five continents, across more than 20 countries and on multiple projects. 

The most recent collaboration has been with colleagues from our business development teams located in India and Singapore to recruit senior government officials in South and Southeast Asia. Less recently, I collaborated with our team Qatar and UAE on the same HP project, and then in Mexico for the development of ad-hoc communication around the celebration of an important anniversary at the British Embassy in Ciudad de MÃ©xico.

###### The opportunities

This journey at Cambridge has given me incredible opportunities. I worked across comms development, crisis comms and reputational risk management for example in Vietnam for Cambridge English and to the development of a project with the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Digital Transformation. These collaborations made me realise even more how much I love to navigate identity and cultural diversities, paying even more attention to sensitivities and communicative differences. 

A particularly proud moment has been when I pushed for the distribution of the 110 years of Cambridge C2 Proficiency exam that secured the organisation a wild coverage on BBC News, ITV News East Anglia, The Daily Mail and The Mirror Online and granted me an opportunity to visit the archives and look first hand at the original C2 paper exam from 1913. In this organisation, I also had the opportunity to attend radio interviews in Italy as well as podcasts and interviews with newspapers such as Business Insider IT.


###### Further development and future of my career

Since I joined the organisation in 2020, I have been supporting the business and Cambridge senior leadership teams to identify risks and new opportunities. I am now looking for getting closer to my family in South Europe, find new opportunities in Marketing and Communication and improve my Spanish language skills hopefully by moving to Spain.
