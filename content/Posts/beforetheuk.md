##### Until 2015

I was born and bred in Sardinia. In 2015, I moved to the UK in Cambridge and after almost 10 years living here, I am now looking for my next adventure in Spain.

I have lived in Italy for most of my life. More than a decade ago, I graduated in Languages and Communication at the University of Cagliari and after spending some years as freelancer tutor of English in Italy, I decided to move to the UK to improve my English language skills but also to seek further professional opportunities.

I was 7 years old when I started studying English. When I was 13 I started writing down song's lyrics while listening to music cassettes to learn more words. English has always been a passion and a top priority in my development. 
I have always imagined living in an English speaking country at some point. While I started learning it in primary school, it was only when teenager and with the advent of MTV music videos that I truly got to appreciate it.

Prior coming to the UK, I worked in very different roles: from a family bakery every summer, to cleaning VIP villas during summertime, I started interpreting and translation during the university in Cagliari. In 2011, I took an internship at a local paint factory that was expanding their operations beyond the Italian border, in North Africa. For Marroncolor s.r.l., I did interpreting and translation services from English/French to Italian and helped with their negotiations during conference calls.

From 2011 to early 2015, while studying for my bachelorâ€™s degree I offered study support and tutoring to young adults with a particular focus on English as a school subject. 

Netflix and real time streaming services weren't a thing at the time, and being a superfan of US and British TV series that were not available on TV yet, I volunteered as a translator for subtitling platforms that were providing subtitles for TV series online.
